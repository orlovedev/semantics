`@priestine/semantics` automates version bumping for your projects. It determines the next version number (you need to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specificationg) for it to work correctly), generates the release notes and publishes the release tag (only GitLab is currently supported).

## Features

* Automated versioning that follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/) spec
* Automatically generated release notes
* Simple and transparent way of releasing your code
* Support for formalized commits that follow widely adopted specifications
* Support for any language
* Simple integration with CI/CD
* Docker image for your entertainment
* Unopinionated behaviour (except for requirements of following SemVer and Conventional Commits)
* Easy-to-use interface for referencing current and generated versions plus the changelog that are generated by `@priestine/semantics` which you can use in your deployment later on

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you don't follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification),
all your commits will be referred to as fixes. This is done to jump into releasing even if you haven't used conventional
commits before.

## WAT?

`@priestine/semantics` uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification) to determine the types of changes in the codebase and determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org/), generates a list of changes (a changelog) and publishes appropriate release tag with the changelog attached to it.

## Execution logic

1. Get the latest release tag for the project
2. Obtain the commit that the latest release tag is bound to
3. Get a list of commits since the latest release commit up to the current one
4. Analyze commits
5. Generate changelog for analyzed commits
6. Use API to create a release tag and append the changelog to the release message
7. Put metadata (see [#output](#output)) in temporary files

You can use add your own logic in the same job after `@priestine/semantics` has finished running, or assign a separate release job that will run on publishing the tag to GitLab.

## Installation

### Docker and GitLab CI (preferred choice)

The easiest way to use the app is to go get the [Dockerfile from Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/priestine/semantics). You can create a separate job in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` that will bump your versions. In fact it is as easy as

```yaml
# .gitab-ci.yml

versioning:
  stage: deploy
  image: priestine/semantics:latest
  script:
  - priestine-semantics
  only:
  - master
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: For the app to be able to publish new tags on GitLab, you need to provide a `PRIVATE_TOKEN` environment variable. If you don't want `@priestine/semantics` to publish tags, simply omit the following step. Without the `PRIVATE_TOKEN` the app will only evaluate changes and put temporary files with metadata grabbed during evaluation (see [#output](#output))

### `PRIVATE_TOKEN`

Private token env variable is in fact a GitLab user access token that is used for publishing tags to GitLab. To create an access token, follow the steps:

1. Go to your profile page (https://gitlab.com/profile)
2. Choose `Access Tokens` in the menu on the left (https://gitlab.com/profile/personal_access_tokens)
3. In the `Name` input, provide something viable like `Semantics`
4. In the **scopes** section, check the `api` checkbox
5. Press the `Create personal access token button`
6. You'll get your newly created access token inside `Your New Personal Access Token` input
7. Copy it and paste it in your private environment variables as `PRIVATE_TOKEN` ([GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments.html))

It is a good idea to create a separate user and use it for the releasing purposes.

`@priestine/semantics` Dockerfile is built from `node:10-alpine`:
